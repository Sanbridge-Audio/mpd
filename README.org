* Docker MPD Container w/ Icecast Casting
MPD and Icecast containers configured specifically to 
cast MPD audio streams.

Heavily based on the work of Jasper Lievisse.

https://blog.jasper.la/mpd-to-sonos-with-icecast.html

The most significant changes are non-hardcoded passwords &&
alpine instead of Ubuntu for Icecast.

** Configuration

I'd recommend using docker-compose to build, 
replacing env vars with your secrets:


#+BEGIN_SRC: yaml
icecast:
  build: icecast
  environment:
    MPD_ICE_PASSWORD: MpdIcePass
    ICE_ADMIN_PASSWORD: IceAdminPassword
  ports:
    - "18000:8000"

mpd:
  build: mpd
  links:
    - icecast
  environment:
    MPD_ADMIN_PASSWORD: MpdAdminPassword
    MPD_ICE_PASSWORD: MpdIcePass
  ports:
    - "6600:6600"
  volumes:
    - /path/to/you/music:/audio
    - $PWD/mpd-data/data:/var/mpd

#+END_SRC

** TODO

Currently using ubuntu base for mpd container. Would prefer alpine but 
permission issues segfaults mpd after completion of the first track.
